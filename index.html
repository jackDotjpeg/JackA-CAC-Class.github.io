        <p>We're no strangers to love<br/>
            You know the rules and so do I (do I)<br/>
            A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br/>
            You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br/>
            I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br/>
            Gotta make you understand<br/>
            Never gonna give you up<br/>
            Never gonna let you down<br/>
            Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>  
            Never gonna make you cry<br/>
            Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
            Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br/>
            We've known each other for so long<br/>
            Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it)<br/>
            Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)<br/>
            We know the game and we're gonna play it<br/>
            And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br/>
            Don't tell me you're too blind to see<br/>
            Never gonna give you up<br/>
            Never gonna let you down<br/>
            Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
